Automatically registers the investigation-runner bootstrap so scheduler tests
can execute tasks without every test having to bind a runner explicitly. The
bootstrap resolves ``tools.investigation.capability.run_investigation`` at call
time, so tests that monkeypatch that attribute still take effect.
