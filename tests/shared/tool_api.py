"""The tool tier's packages and the modules it may be imported through.

``core/tool/`` owns the tool contract, execution and the registry port;
``core/tool_framework/`` holds the authoring helpers (``@tool``, skill guidance,
shared payload utilities). Together they are one tier to their consumers.

Neither root exports anything yet, so every import below is internal and the
border test's allowlists record exactly that. Introducing an API module is the
next step; the allowlists are how it gets measured.
