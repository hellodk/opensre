"""A turn the action already answered must not be answered again by gather.

Asking "what's the current error rate on github?" under an active session goal
produced two different numbers in one turn: the action phase streamed 3.03%
(latest 100 runs) under ``OpenSRE``, then gather ran and streamed 5.14%
(24-hour window) under ``assistant``.

The action phase decides whether to paint its closing from the *planner's*
handoffs. The orchestrator then appends its own guidance tags — an evidence-tier
tag, and ``session_goal:continue`` while a goal is active — and used to hand the
augmented tuple to the router. ``route_turn`` reads a non-empty tuple as "the
planner asked the assistant to answer", so a handled turn became a gather turn
after its answer was already on screen.
