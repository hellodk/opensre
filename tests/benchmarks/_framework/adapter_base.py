"""Abstract benchmark adapter base class.

Each benchmark suite (CloudOpsBench, ToolCallBench, etc.) implements
this interface to bridge its corpus / scoring / agent surface to the
framework. The framework calls these methods; adapters do the
benchmark-specific work.

Split out from the original ``adapters.py`` so the type contracts in
``types.py`` and the registry in ``registry.py`` can be imported without
pulling in the late-binding TYPE_CHECKING surface this module needs to
type-check ``investigation_agent_class()``-style hooks against
``ConnectedInvestigationAgent``.

This module deliberately has zero product-package imports at module load — the
framework is independent of opensre internals. The TYPE_CHECKING block
below is type-checker-only and never executes at runtime.
