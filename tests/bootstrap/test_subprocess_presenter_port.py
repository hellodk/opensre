"""The default agent must be able to run shell tools after process boot.

``AgentSession.start()`` is the documented Python entry point. With no
subprocess presenter, ``shell_run`` refuses every call ("subprocess presenter
is required for this action tool") and the agent silently degrades to writing
a plan it cannot execute — which reads as a reasoning failure but is a wiring
gap. Observed live: the 5-step goal prompt returned PLANNED=4 / EXECUTED=0.

The presenter cannot be a core default: it lives in ``tools`` (its process
helpers) and ``core.agent_harness`` may import neither ``tools`` nor
``gateway``. It is registered on this port at process boot instead.
