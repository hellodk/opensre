"""Email delivery for background RCA completion notifications.

The other three channels each had their own module; email was inlined in the
dispatcher, which is why the SMTP config lookup ran on every completion even
when no email channel was configured. It lives here now, so the lookup happens
only when email was actually requested.

Email keeps the full report. The chat channels carry the bounded summary from
``infrastructure.delivery.notifications.rca_summary``.
