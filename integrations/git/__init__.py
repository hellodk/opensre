"""Local git client: vendor-neutral branch/commit/push/status helpers.

Public surface for callers that need safe local git operations (e.g. shipping a
code change as a branch + commit + push). Operations raise :class:`GitCommandError`
with a stable ``kind`` that callers map onto their own error model.
