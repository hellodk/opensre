"""What kind of evidence a turn is asking for — vocabulary + per-kind policy.

A leaf so ``evidence_need`` (which classifies) and ``assistant_handoff`` (which
parses the planner's tag) can both name the vocabulary without importing each
other. Holding it in either of them makes the pair a cycle.

Open/closed: add a kind by extending the enum **and** registering its
:class:`EvidenceKindPolicy` here (or via :func:`register_evidence_kind_policy`).
Do not grow ``if kind is …`` branches inside ``classify_evidence_need``.
