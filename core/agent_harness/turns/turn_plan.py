"""Turn-wide assembly: the decisions one turn runs on.

Assembled once at the top of ``run_turn`` and read by the action, gather, and
answer phases so they cannot disagree about what this turn knows. It composes the
frozen :class:`TurnSnapshot` (the read view of session state at turn start) with
the turn's resolved-integration decision.

The snapshot answers "what did the session look like at turn start?"; the plan
answers "what is this turn running on?". ``build_turn_plan`` owns the assembly:
it resolves integrations once and composes them into the snapshot. Tool lists and
prompts stay built by their phases (action tools need surface context; gather
tools depend on message-time GitHub scope), each reading ``resolved_integrations``
here so there is one source.
