"""Decoupled turn engine: three-path routing + conversational assistant.

This is the surface-agnostic heart of the turn harness, lifted out of the
interactive shell. It owns:

* ``stream_answer`` — one no-tool streamed answer from the grounded
  conversational assistant (guidance only; no investigation run). A single
  streaming LLM call with no ReAct loop and no tool use. Records the exchange.
* ``run_turn`` — the three-path routing (summarize-observation / handled /
  gather+answer) that sequences the action driver, the gather pass, and the
  answer path.

All terminal/session/grounding/telemetry concerns are reached through the
Protocols in :mod:`core.agent_harness.ports`. Nothing here imports ``interactive_shell``.
