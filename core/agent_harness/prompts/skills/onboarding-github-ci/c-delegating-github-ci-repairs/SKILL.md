  usecases:
    - For interactive-shell users running a GitHub CI repair on their hosted gateway.
  requires:
    - A reachable hosted gateway with a GitHub integration and an authenticated coding agent.
    - An interactive shell and a signed-in OpenSRE account in the organization for hosted gateway access.
    - GitHub write access to the selected PR; demo mode also needs private-repository creation.

# Delegate a remote CI repair

This runs one bounded repair that finishes on the gateway without the shell. It does not set up continuous repository monitoring.

## Roles

**Orchestrator (local shell):**

- Checks the gateway is ready, picks the target, delegates, verifies and reports.

**Executor (gateway):**

- Runs the repair with the skill `scheduling-github-ci-repairs` and reports back to the shell.

## Plan

Use `update_plan` to create the live plan from the workflow headings below:

**Inside the interactive shell:**

- [ ] Prepare the hosted gateway with check_hosted_gateway.
- [ ] Probe GitHub access on the gateway with one ask_hosted_gateway prompt.

**Inside the interactive shell:**

- [ ] Confirm the target and approval in one ask_user_choice question.
- [ ] Delegate execution with ask_hosted_gateway and retain its prompt ID.


**Remote Gateway agent:**

- [ ] Read the following skill: `scheduling-github-ci-repairs` to understand how to seed a demo PR and inside a demo repository and how to fix it. 
- [ ] Create the demo repository, failing branch, and PR (demo only).
- [ ] Confirm GitHub reports the failure with list_github_actions_workflow_runs.
- [ ] Schedule the bounded repair with schedule_ci_repair_loop and record its task id.
- [ ] Wait for the scheduled tick with get_ci_repair_loop and read its report.
- [ ] Verify the repair with one `pr view` call.
- [ ] Save evidence, remove the demo loop, and verify with `/cron list`. Nothing on GitHub is deleted; the demo repository is kept.
- [ ] Respond with the outcome report as Markdown.

**Inside the interactive shell:**

- [ ] Verify the outcome by re-reading the delegated prompt ID (verifies: true).
- [ ] Show the remote outcome and evidence as Markdown.
- [ ] Offer the next step or blocker resolution with ask_user_choice.

## Success criteria

The workflow succeeds only when:

1. The hosted gateway is healthy with active GitHub permissions.
2. A seed demo repository is configured with a failing PR 
3. The CI failure is detected remotely.
4. The remote repair loop fixes the failure without intervention from the local shell.

## Workflow Notes

### Prepare the hosted gateway

**Shell only:**

- Run `check_hosted_gateway()`. If it is not running, call `start_hosted_gateway()` once and check again until it is ready.
- Do not send a test prompt. The probe below is the first prompt, and its answer proves the gateway takes prompts.

**Complete when:**

- `check_hosted_gateway()` reports the gateway running.

### Probe GitHub access

Send one `ask_hosted_gateway` prompt:

Report this gateway's GitHub access for a CI repair demo. Run only these calls and create nothing:

- [1] `github_cli ["api", "user", "--include"]` for the login. An `X-OAuth-Scopes` header means a classic PAT: list its scopes, which need `repo` and `workflow` (the demo pushes a workflow file). No header means a fine-grained or app token.

- [2] `github_cli ["api", "user/memberships/orgs", "--jq", "[.[] | {org: .organization.login, role, state}]"]`

- [3] For each organization: `github_cli ["api", "graphql", "-f", "query=query($o: String!) { organization(login: $o) { viewerCanCreateRepositories } }", "-F", "o=<org>"]`, Answer with the login, the token type and scopes, and one line per owner (the login plus each organization) saying whether it can create repositories. Then propose a name for a new demo repository as `<owner>/<name>`; it does not exist yet.

**Complete when:**

- The gateway named the login, the token type, and at least one owner that can create repositories. Otherwise, a blocker is recorded.

### Display the final repair plan

Show the final repair plan titled `Remote Repair Plan`. Put the probe's findings (login, token type, owner) in the overview so the user can see it once. 

- `Create <owner>/<name> and run the demo there`
- `Use an existing pull request`

**Complete when:**

- When the chosen scope is known. 
- Keep asking with `ask_user_choice` if not all required parameters are known. 

### Delegate the repair

- Send one `ask_hosted_gateway` prompt: "This is a new request. Start a new plan from `scheduling-github-ci-repairs` for <target>; do not reuse plan steps, task IDs, or repositories from earlier in this conversation. Delete nothing on GitHub."
- Pass the target as `facts` (`demo`, `owner`, `repo`, `pr_number`). Keep the prompt ID.


**Complete when:** the gateway returned a task ID and outcome, or a blocker.

### Verify the remote outcome

- Call `ask_hosted_gateway(prompt_id=<the delegated prompt ID>)` once. Do not send a new prompt.
- Check the record against the delegated report: same task ID, a fix commit, a passing run ID, and the loop removed.
- If it says the gateway is not running, do not start it just to verify. Mark this step blocked with "gateway stopped after reporting; the delegated report is unverified" and show that report.

**Complete when:**

- The re-read matches the report, or the step is blocked with its reason.

### Show the outcome in a report

- Report the target PR, task ID, repair outcome, available CI evidence links, and retained resources. State pending, blocked, or failed outcomes plainly and concisely. 

- The task's gateway ownership establishes independence from the shell; claim a tested disconnect only if the shell was actually disconnected during execution.

- Show the report once. Do not repeat the gateway's streamed steps.

**Complete when:**

- When the Markdown report has been shown. Keep the gateway running so an unfinished repair can continue.

### Offer the follow-up

After a successful repair report, use `ask_user_choice`:

- Configure Slack or Telegram
- Add more scheduled tasks
- Exit to interactive shell

**Complete when:**

- The appropriate menu is offered. 
- Keep this step pending until the report has been shown


### Blockers 

**GitHub connection blocker:**

- If missing credentials, direct the user to https://app.opensre.com/dashboard/github and follow the tool's continuation guidance after it is corrected.

**Complete when:**

- The blockers are resolved or the user wants to write their own specific answer. 
- For a pending task, offer to continue observing the same task ID or leave it running. 
- Keep these recovery choices separate from the successful-demo options above.
