# Onboarding for Scheduled CI fixes

Monitor one repository every **30 seconds** and automatically edit, test,
and push fixes to one failing PR branch per tick. A green PR does not stop
monitoring.

The private demo uses the same repair policy and the same cadence.

## Goal

Get the user to a running scheduled loop that repairs a failing PR, and show
one real repair as fast as possible in well under five minutes.

## Plan

Use `update_plan` to create the live plan from the workflow headings below:

- [ ] Check prerequisites: GitHub identity and scopes, then the scheduler.
- [ ] Select the repository, or the private demo, with ask_user_choice.
- [ ] Select the failing PR, or confirm the authorized demo scope.
- [ ] Create the demo repository, failing branch, and PR (demo only).
- [ ] Schedule the bounded repair with schedule_ci_repair_loop and record its task id.
- [ ] Wait for the scheduled tick with `get_ci_repair_loop` and read its report.
- [ ] Verify the repair with one `pr view` call.
- [ ] Save evidence, remove the demo loop and resources, verify with `/cron list`.
- [ ] Respond with the outcome report as Markdown.
- [ ] After the report is shown, offer the follow-up with `ask_user_choice`.

## Workflow

### Step 1. Check prerequisites

Two calls, one per response:

**confirm authentication and print token:**

- `github_cli` `["api", "user", "--include"]` — confirms authentication and
  prints the token's `X-Oauth-Scopes` header.

**check scheduler health:**

- `slash_invoke` `{"command": "/cron", "args": ["list"]}` — confirms the
  scheduler answers.

**Complete this step when:**

- GitHub identity, token scopes, and the scheduler are confirmed.

### Step 2. Select the repository

Use the repository already named by the user and skip the rest of this step.
Otherwise, two calls, one per response:

**find what is red right now:**

- `scan_github_ci_health()` — every repository of the user's account and
  organizations, default branch and open PRs only. Read `failing_prs`;

**ask once:**

- `ask_user_choice` titled "CI Repair Target": "Private disposable demo
  repository" first (recommended), then one option per repository that
  still has at least one failing PR, labelled `owner/repo — N failing PRs`,
  most failures first, at most six. A repository with no failing PR is not
  offered; a loop there would idle. If the scan returns
  `available: false`, offer the demo and the configured repositories as
  before and say the live scan was unavailable.

Choosing the demo authorizes creating a private repository, its branch, PR, and loop. Keep the scan result: Step 3 selects the PR from it without a second GitHub read.

**Complete this step when:**

- When the repository, or the demo scope, is established.

### Step 3. Select the failure scenario

**Existing repository:**

- `summarize_github_pr_status(owner, repo, state="open", include_checks=true)`
- pick the user's PR, or the first PR with a failing check
- do not use forked repository PRs, they will not work.
- If none is failing, the loop still starts in Step 6 and Step 7 is
  skipped.

**Demo repository creation ("Demo")**
The scope was authorized in Step 1; nothing to fetch.

**Complete this step when:**

- PR from existing repository is selected or the demo is authorized to create a PR in a demo repository.

### Step 4. Create the demo failure (Demo only)

Build a small repository whose CI fails for one obvious reason, and open a PR for it. Choose the calls yourself with `github_cli`; it carries the GitHub credentials, and plain `git` on the gateway does not.

The fixture:

- `main` passes: `calculator.py` where `add` returns `left + right`, `test_calculator.py` asserting `add(2, 3) == 5`, and `.github/workflows/test.yml` named `Demo calculator CI` running `python -m unittest -v` on push and pull_request.
- `demo/failing-ci` is one commit ahead and changes only `calculator.py`, so `add` subtracts.

Create the repository first (private, under the approved owner), then commit the files, then open the PR from `demo/failing-ci` into `main` and say in its body that it is a demo not to merge. Reuse anything that already exists instead of recreating it.

**Complete this step when:**

- The PR URL is returned to the user.

### Step 5. Schedule the bounded repair

One call for the PR selected in Step 3 or created in Step 4:

`schedule_ci_repair_loop(owner="<owner>", repo="<repo>", pr_number=<n>)`

The tool starts and checks the local background scheduler itself, registers a real 30-second cron task whose tick calls the CI fixer directly, and stops the task on its own once the PR is green or ten minutes have passed.

It asks for one approval

Record `task_id`, `pr_url`, and `next_run` from the result. `task_id` is the scheduler's task id: `/cron list` and `/cron logs <task_id>` read it.

If the result says `reused: true`, an earlier run for the same PR is still active; keep its id and deadline and do not schedule again.

**Complete this step when:**

- Task id is recorded.

### Step 6. Watch the repair

Do not run `/cron run <id>`. The scheduler picks the task up at `next_run`,
at most 30 seconds away, and owns the repair from there: attempts, CI
verification, and the deadline. On the hosted gateway a slash command is
stopped after 90 seconds, and a stopped `/cron run` takes the repair with it.

Call `get_ci_repair_loop(task_id="<id>", wait_seconds=60)`, one call per
response, until the result has `terminal: true`. Its `response_text` is the
detection and repair evidence.

Skip this step when Step 3 found no failing PR.

Read the work outcome separately from delivery: a delivered report can describe
a blocked or failed repair.

Do not schedule again or ask for another attempt; the task makes up to three
attempts on its own. If the result's deadline has passed and the run is still
not terminal, stop waiting and go to Step 7: the PR shows what happened.

**Complete this step when:**

- The result has `terminal: true` and its outcome is recorded, or
- The deadline has passed and the run is recorded as unfinished.

### Step 7. Verify the repair

One call: `github_cli ["pr", "view", "<n>", "--json", "headRefOid,commits,statusCheckRollup"]`

The head must be a new commit by the fix, every rollup entry `SUCCESS`, and the test file untouched in the fix commit's file list.

Do not run the tests locally, do not fetch the same state through a second tool, and do not clone the repository again.

If a check is still running, wait 20 seconds once and repeat the same call.

**Complete this step when:**

- The head commit's checks pass; otherwise try again.

### Step 8. Clean up (demo only)

In this order, no verification calls in between:

1. `write_demo_evidence(repo, pr_number, loop_id, outcome, failed_run_id,
   fix_commit, passing_run_id, blocker)` saves evidence under
   `~/.opensre/demo-results/` and removes the owned temp checkout. Omit
   unavailable IDs for failed or blocked demos. Record the returned evidence
   path and `checkout_removed` status. If saving fails before cleanup, the
   helper retains the checkout. Continue to loop removal after any failure.
2. Always call `slash_invoke` `{"command": "/cron", "args": ["remove", "<id>"]}`,
   including after an evidence-tool failure. The
   demo repository is never deleted; report that the repository remains.
3. `slash_invoke` `{"command": "/cron", "args": ["list"]}` as the single
   verification.

For an existing repository the loop stays; only record its id.

Complete when the loop is gone and remaining resources are documented.

### Step 9. Report

Respond with the report as Markdown, linking the PR inline: PR, failed run id, loop id, fix commit, final check result, cleanup status, evidence path.

Claim success only when detection, scheduled repair, passing checks, and (for the demo) loop removal are all evidenced.

**Complete this step when:**
Complete when the report has been shown to the user as Markdown text.

### Step 10. Offer the follow-up question

After the report is shown, one `ask_user_choice`:

- "Set up remote continious monitoring
- "Set up local monitoring for another repository"
- "Exit demo"

**Complete this step when:**

- Complete when the menu has been offered.
