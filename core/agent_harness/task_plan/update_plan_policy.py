    settles every step (completed or blocked) — a text-only final step has no

    finding the blocker *is* that step's outcome (a capability gate read
    through bookkeeping tools has nothing else to show). Neither covers a plan
    with no stored prior or a step that was still ``pending``, so a checklist
    cannot be born or bulk-ticked complete. ``blocked`` is not a completion
    and is never demoted: it records work that did not happen, with the
