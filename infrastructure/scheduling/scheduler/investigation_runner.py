"""Investigation-runner seam for the scheduled-delivery subsystem.

The scheduler needs to invoke the investigation pipeline (``run_investigation``
in :mod:`tools.investigation.capability`) to build reports for kinds such as
``daily_summary`` and ``weekly_audit``. Doing that directly from
``infrastructure.scheduling.scheduler`` reintroduces a ``platform -> tools`` layering violation
(T-4 layering audit, issue #3352).

This module inverts the dependency: the scheduler declares a small
:class:`InvestigationRunner` protocol and calls it through
:func:`invoke_investigation_runner`. A startup path in a higher layer (the
``opensre cron`` command and the scheduler bootstrap in
:mod:`tools.investigation.scheduler_bootstrap`) registers the concrete
implementation via :func:`register_investigation_runner`.

Tests that patch ``tools.investigation.capability.run_investigation`` continue
to work because the bootstrap module re-reads that attribute on every scheduler
invocation instead of binding it at import time.
