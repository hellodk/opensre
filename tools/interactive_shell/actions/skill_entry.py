"""Enter an action-agent skill: activate it on the session and run its ``pre_execute`` hooks.

One entry point serves every way into a skill. The model enters through the
``skill_view`` tool; the host enters directly (interactive startup, ``/demo``)
with no model step and no tool-event render. A skill's ``pre_execute`` calls run
here through the real tool executors, so a hook-queued menu behaves exactly as
if the model had called the tool. Only allowlisted tools may run from a hook.
