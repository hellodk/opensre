"""Synchronized terminal output (DECSET 2026) for multi-step repaints.

A terminal that implements the mode holds every write between the begin and
end markers off-screen and presents them as one frame, so an erase and the
redraw that replaces it never show as two states. Only VT-capable outputs
receive the markers; native Win32 output would print them as text.

The terminal mode itself does not nest: a second end marker presents whatever
has been written, whoever wrote it. This wrapper coalesces overlapping callers
on the same output into one frame so only the final caller emits the end marker.
