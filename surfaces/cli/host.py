"""What the process entrypoint hands the CLI: how to open the shell and how to run the gateway attached.

The CLI never imports the interactive shell or the gateway composition; the
entrypoint that composes the surfaces passes these callables in through the
click context, and the CLI prints the landing page or an error when a host did
not provide them.
