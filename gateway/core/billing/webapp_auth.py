"""Pick the credential for the gateway's credit-metering calls to opensre-webapp.

Two credentials exist: this silo's org-scoped machine token (minted from
``CLERK_MACHINE_SECRET_KEY``) and the shared ``AGENT_USAGE_SECRET``. Webapp
routes differ in which they accept, so this module exposes one accessor per
acceptance rule rather than a single "the token" — a caller that picks the
wrong one gets a 401 that looks like an empty result.

Lives here because ``credits_client`` is the only consumer: the vault reads the
shared secret itself (``integrations.webapp_vault``), and nothing else mints a
machine token.

  - :func:`webapp_bearer_token`  — routes accepting either credential
  - :func:`webapp_machine_token` — routes accepting only the machine token
  - :func:`webapp_shared_secret` — routes accepting only the shared secret

Lives here rather than in ``config/`` because minting reaches
``clerk_tokens``: putting the choice in the constants leaf would make ``config``
depend upward on ``integrations`` and form an import cycle.
